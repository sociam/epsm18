We call for papers for this workshop. Our aim is to promote dialogue between disciplines, and particularly the application of moral philosophical, critical and legal principles in the context of social relations on the World Wide Web, in order to support the construction of an ethical framework for Web Science. The intended audience includes those with an interest in ethical issues pertaining to the Web, including practitioners in areas such as healthcare, law, communications/media and social science whose work poses ethical challenges from which Web Scientists can learn.

Papers will be favoured which use a multidisciplinary framework. We are particularly interested in detailed case studies, philosophical frameworks, legal analyses, policy studies and comparative analyses. We will favour papers describing original research, but will also consider novel position papers and works-in-progress. We will want to see evidence that the approaches reported (a) address a specific and genuine problem in this area, and (b) have implications for the future of the World Wide Web. We will give priority to full papers, but also welcome vision papers, white papers and works-in-progress, which will be included.

Relevant topics include (but are not limited to):
- How feasible is it to construct ethical principles in this space, or will they always be derivative from principles which apply to individuals?
- Are there simple ideas that can carry over from existing ethical frameworks, such as intergenerational justice or rights pertaining to minorities?
- Do the three types of group outlined here face similar, or different challenges?
- Are these groups at the right level of abstraction for discussing Web-based ethical issues?
- What methodological problems are posed for those researching into such groups (and how may they be resolved)?
- How should access to data be regulated?
- What role is there for Web Observatories?
- How do algorithmic biases affect group composition or intra-group relations?
- Who is accountable for harms resulting from an algorithmâ€™s application to a group?
- Can we create protections analogous to data protection without personal data or PII?
- Who is to represent a particular group if it is to be defended against a possible harm?

Papers may be up to 6 pages, written using the ACM double column template available from the [ACM website](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template), selecting the SIGCONF proceedings template.
